#
# Getting the Excel COM object
#
# PyXLL has a function 'get_active_object'. This returns
# a PyIDispatch object for the Excel window instance.
# It is better to use this than
# win32com.client.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
# as it will always be the correct handle - ie the handle
# to the correct instance of Excel.
#
# The window object can be wrapped as a
# win32com.client.Dispatch object to make it
# easier to use, as shown in these examples.
#
# For more information on win32com see the pywin32 project
# on sourceforge.
#
# The Excel object model is the same from COM as from VBA
# so usually it's straightforward to write something
# in python if you know how to do it in VBA.
#
# For more information about the Excel object model
# see MSDN or the object browser in the Excel VBA editor.
